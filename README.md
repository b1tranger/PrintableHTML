# modPagesForPDFcrowd
Modified HTML pages to be processed by PDFcrowd Extension so I can make PDF out of them : (


This Extension: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-as-pdf/kpdjmbiefanbdgnkcikhllpmjnnllbbc](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-as-pdf/kpdjmbiefanbdgnkcikhllpmjnnllbbc) <-- [https://pdfcrowd.com/](https://pdfcrowd.com/)

Using the Extension in some pages like this one with side columns ( unneeded parts for reading ) will wither break the PDF or not load at all.

Example page:

PDFcrowd shows:

Printing breaks or loads only a single page:

The Extension does not work with just saving page as HTML. And even after modiying and removing other columns / sections, the extension does not work for offline HTML pages.

Only after making it available online I can made PDFs using the extension.
